You probably noticed this already, but just in case: my name is Stefan De Boey. I'm a *software developer*, interested in programming languages, web development and all that fun stuff.

At the moment I'm mainly working with the [Mojolly](http://www.mojolly.com/) guys on [BackChat.io](https://backchat.io/), which is easiest to describe as *grep for real-time data*.

In case you're interested in me or my work, then check out some of my [projects](http://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/) on GitHub, [connect](http://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin }}/) with me on LinkedIn or just [tweet](http://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}/) me. And if you want even more of me on the internets, look [here](/elsewhere.html).
